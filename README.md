# Soulbound

- Items with this enchantment are kept in inventory on death
- Configurable chance for the enchantment to be removed on death

Enchantment soulboundEnchantment = SoulboundAPI.getSoulboundEnchantment();

// Create a Soulbound enchanted book
ItemStack soulboundBook = SoulboundAPI.createSoulboundBook();

// Create a Soulbound enchanted book with custom name and lore
List<String> lore = new ArrayList<>();
